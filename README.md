## Blog project with Python Django
To run the code, you must first open it in the compiler, then to the terminal respectively ; -->
python manage.py runserver after that in any browser you must go to this address ;
### To Run
localhost:8000  If this does not work for you, you can add many alternatives to this number.

To access the admin panel ; localhost:8000/admin



If you get an error when running the first code in the terminal and then entering it in the browser means it doesn't see the database
It is very easy to add a new database for this, but it would be more useful if you look over the internet as it is necessary to explain it with pictures.
